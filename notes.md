# Elm in Action - Notes:

## Page summaries:
- p. 8 : Strong type system, also for operators (+ for numbers, ++ for strings)
- p. 10: conventions:
    - all letters in a naming should be uninterrupted 
    - camelCase is preferred
- p. 10: "An expression is anything that evaluates to a single value."
    - Everything in Elm is mostly an expression. It's the basic building block: especially functions
    - The classic `if{...} else{} ` from js is not an expression, the ternary is one, because it evaluates to a single value
        - `if` in Elm is used therefore in "if-Expressions", rather then "if-Statements"
